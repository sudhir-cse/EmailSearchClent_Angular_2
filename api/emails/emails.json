Sorry we could not make it\nto the party. The temperature is very warm here\nin Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently\nand it looks like it is doing fine. I am\nparticularly interested in your venture into the\nfiber optics communications business and the\nwindpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular\nbusiness last year and I think the land line\ncompany will be sold soon. We sold to Allied\nTelephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other\nengineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together\nabout 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system\nfrom East to West across Kansas. That was sold\nwith the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nKick off your party with Yahoo! Invites.\nhttp://invites.yahoo.com/\n\n",

I'm working at it! \n\nRosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you \nby phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? \nGovernor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, \nhas enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on \nnatural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- \nbefore it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in \ncontrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current \nchairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the \nauspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of \nother distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.\n\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking \noff the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility \nplatform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have \nyou in that featured role in it works for your schedule.\n\nIt takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \n\nTony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very \nlarge for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in \nfurther on what they would like to accomplish.\n\nIf it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, \nthat would be great. \n\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. \n\nBest, \n\nDan \n\n\n",
